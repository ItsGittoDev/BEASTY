# BEASTY
BEASTY is a virus that destroys your PC,
but it doesn't corrupt your files or like that, its just an annoying virus.

# Ways to remove:
- Safe mode (Recommended)
- Using CMD on boot
- Reinstalling Windows
- Deleting it from it's base (Startup)

# Using Safe Mode

To remove it from safe mode, you must shutdown your PC. Then, you need to shutdown it at boot until a "Automatic Repair" message appears. Wait until it finishes. Then, go to advanced settings. It should appear some options. Click on safe mode. Choose a mode, and then go ahead. On safe mode, use Win + R and write *shell:startup*. Then, delete the bat file. Don't forget to delete the hidden scripts.

# Using CMD on boot

Follow the steps above. But instead of selecting safe mode, use CMD. Then write *notepad*. Go to *C:\Users\(Your user)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Start* and delete the files.

# Reinstalling Windows

This is the WORST way to remove it. You can lost data and, maybe the entire disk if you don't have a *cloud* (OneDrive, Drive, MEGA, etc.) You can get Windows 10 ISO from the Microsoft Official Page.

# Deleting it from it's base (Startup)

This is a REALLY HARD way, because due to loop, you couldn't make it. But you must use Win + R and write *shell:startup*. Then delete the files and restart.
